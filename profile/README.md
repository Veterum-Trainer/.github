## What it does

Veterum is a tactical strategy game set in a post-apocalyptic world where you command squads to reclaim territory.

This trainer enhances your gameplay by providing instant resources, unlimited stamina, and advanced AI control.

## Features

| Option | Hotkey | What it does |
|---|---|---|

| Infinite Stamina | `F2` | Never run out of stamina to move, attack, or use special abilities. |
| Instant Unit Upgrade | `F3` | Upgrade any unit instantly, bypassing the usual time and cost requirements. |
| Resource Allocation Slider | slider | `1x`–`50x`, default `3x` |
| Stamina Management Slider | slider | `0%`–`100%` — the softer alternative to Infinite resources |
| Crew Management `crew` | `F4` | Assign and reassign crew members to different roles on the fly, with no cooldowns. |
| Bypass Restrictions `bypass` | `F5` | Disable in-game restrictions like quest gating and event timers. |

| Unlock all All Achievements and Skins | — | Persistent |
| Free camera | `F10` | Detach from the character |
| Hide HUD | `F11` | For screenshots |

<sub>Tags — **`crew`**: changes the shared session · **`bypass`**: removes the work the game is built around · **`spoiler`**: reveals story early · **`save`**: writes persistent data · **`EA`**: unfinished Early Access system · **`comfort`**: accessibility, changes nothing. Use at most three. Anything tagged `bypass` or `spoiler` ships off.</sub>

## Hotkeys

`Insert` opens the menu · `End` resets everything · `F1`–`F12` as above, all rebindable · arrow keys and `Enter` navigate without a mouse

> [!TIP]
> Use the 'Reset Trainer' option if you encounter any glitches.

> [!WARNING]
> Using this trainer may cause instability. Save your game before enabling.
>
> Options tagged `save` write persistent data that a patch can invalidate. Back up first and disable cloud sync while you experiment.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>Will I get banned?</summary>
No. Will using the trainer get me banned?, no anti-cheat, no ranked mode. Achievements unlock locally unless you block them in the menu.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Is the trainer safe to use with the latest patch?</summary>
Yes, the trainer has been updated to support patch 1.3.0 and is fully compatible.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I use the trainer in multiplayer?</summary>
The trainer is designed for single-player only. Multiplayer use is not supported.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Does it work on Steam Deck or Linux?</summary>
No. Windows only. Proton changes how the game's memory is laid out and this build does not handle that.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Windows Defender flagged the download.</summary>
Trainers read and write another process's memory, which is what a lot of malware also does, so heuristic scanners flag them on principle. Every release ships with a SHA256 checksum and full source. Add an exclusion if you are comfortable with that — and if you would rather not, don't. That is a reasonable call.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Options stopped working after an update.</summary>
Patches move memory offsets and options fail independently, so some will keep working. Check the Releases page for a build matching your game version.
</details>

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Nothing happens on `Insert` | Another overlay grabbed the key — Steam, Discord or RTSS. Rebind the menu key. |
| "Process not found" | The game must be running with a save loaded. Launch it first, then attach. |
| Some users report crashes after enabling the trainer. options do nothing | That memory allocates only in When launching the game after the trainer is active.. Get there first, then toggle. |
| Unlocks vanished after a patch | A persistent write was invalidated. Restore a backup from before the update. |
| Unexpected crash or freeze. | Ensure the trainer is the latest version and run the game as administrator. |

## Reporting a problem

[Open an issue](../../issues) with your **exact game build number** — that matters more than everything else combined — plus your store, Windows version, where you were in the game, and which single option misbehaved.

## Changelog

<!-- One line per release. Do not invent a version history — the Releases tab
     is one click away and an empty one under a long changelog reads badly. -->
